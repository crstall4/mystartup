[My Notes](notes.md)

## 🚀 Specification Deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [X] Description of key features
- [ ] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Learning a new language can be expensive. There are so many platforms that all want you to pay a monthly subscription fee, just to offer a service that could create myself. LangLearn allows you to study flashcards, watch youtube videos, and more, while secretly remembering the words you have learned in the background. It also provides a spaced review option that allows you to practice words you espeically want to learn.

### Design

![Design image](UI.jpeg)

Login Page: Access your account
Friends Page: See what your friends are/were studying.
Flashcards Page: Study a predefined deck of flashcards.
Spaced Review Page: Study the flashcards that you don't know as well. (auto-generated)
Youtube Page: Watch youtube videos with the captions below. You can click on captions to see a definition.
Explore Decks Page: Allows you to find decks created/used by other users.


### Key features

- Study YouTube or Flashcard decks, while the program finds out what words you don't know as well.
- Spaced Reptition uses the SM-2 algorithm to find out what flashcards need to be studied the most. This allows you to review the words right when you might forget them.
- See what your friends are studying!
